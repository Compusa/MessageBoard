RESTful API to serve as the backend for a public message board. This is the very first draft of the message board, and it was created on my spare time (after my working days) in less than a week. 

There is still much left to do, improve or consider such as:

* Docker support
* Pagination
* HATEOAS
* Nullable reference types
* Use authentication instead of passing around a clientId
* Better test coverage and integration tests
* FluentValidation for commands
* Logging and error handling
* Richer and more robust DDD implementation
